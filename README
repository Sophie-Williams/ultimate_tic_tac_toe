General algorithm

- Get list of available macros

- IF there are macros where EP's exist:
    - Find EP's that send opponent to boards the least in their control (their pieces - your pieces)
    - IF there is exactly one such EP:
        - (PLAY) Make that play
    - ELSE IF multiple such EP's exist:
        - Choose one in the following priority: Center, Corner, Edge
        - IF multiple options of equally high priority exist:
            - (PLAY) Choose randomly

- ELSE IF no macro's have EP's:
    - Determine which diagonal you have a better chance of winning on: SUM(your pieces) along both and compare
    - (PLAY)

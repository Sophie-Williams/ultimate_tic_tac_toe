- Get list of available macro boards from the game engine

- From the list of available macro boards, determine which have available edge-plays

- IF there are available macro boards where edge-plays exist:
    - Find edge-plays that send opponent to boards where you have the most advantage
    - IF there is exactly one such edge-play:
        - (PLAY) Make that play
    - ELSE IF multiple such edge-plays exist:
        - Choose one in a macro board of the following priority: (1) Center, (2) Corner, (3) Edge
        - IF multiple options of equally high priority exist:
            - Choose the macro board in which you have the highest advantage
            - IF multiple such macro boards are tied for highest advantage:
                - (PLAY) Choose randomly

- ELSE IF no available macro boards have edge-plays:
    - Find corner-plays that send opponent to the board where you have the most advantage
    - IF there is exactly one such corner-play:
        - (PLAY) Make that play
    - ELSE IF multiple such corner-plays exist:
        - Choose one of those corner-plays in the macro board in which you have a greater advantage
        - IF multiple such macro boards are tied for highest advantage:
            - (PLAY) Choose randomly

- ELSE IF no macro boards have corner-plays:
    - Play for the center board
